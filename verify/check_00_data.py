"""Check 0 -- are the datasets and artefacts the labs need in place?

    python3 verify/check_00_data.py        exit 0: everything setup.sh promised is here
                                           exit 3: something is missing -- run  bash setup.sh

`setup.sh` runs `python3 data/prepare.py`, which generates every dataset the labs
read (or verifies the ones that ship), trains any artefacts, and writes
data/MANIFEST.json: one entry per file with its row count, column count and a
content hash. This check reads that manifest and re-verifies each entry, so a
student is told "your data is not there" before being told "your code is
wrong" -- the two are different states and the exit codes keep them apart
(0 green, 1 wrong, 2 not written, 3 environment not ready).
