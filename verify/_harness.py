"""The check harness.

Four outcomes, and the exit code says which:

    0   the lab is written and correct
    2   the lab has not been written yet
    1   the lab has been written and is wrong
    3   the environment is not ready, so nothing could be graded

Code 2 is deliberate and separate. "Not started" and "broken" are different
states and a student deserves to be told which one they are in. Every message
names the file, the function and the lab number, so that a red terminal is a
next action rather than a mood.

Code 3 is separate for the same reason. A missing library or a missing trained
artefact is the machine's fault, and reporting it as code 1 sends a student
hunting for a bug in code that is correct.

#      does not pass for an argument.
